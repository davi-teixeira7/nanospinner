# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1]

### Changed

- README: removed Motivation and Features sections — the comparison table covers both
- README: removed API method tables for SpinnerHandle, MultiSpinnerHandle, and SpinnerLineHandle — linked to docs.rs instead
- README: added `spinach` to the comparison table
- README: corrected `spinoff` dependency count from 4 to 3

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- `warn()` and `warn_with()` finalization methods on `SpinnerHandle` and `SpinnerLineHandle` — yellow ⚠ symbol
- `info()` and `info_with()` finalization methods on `SpinnerHandle` and `SpinnerLineHandle` — blue ℹ symbol
- `LineStatus::Warned`, `WarnedWith`, `Informed`, `InformedWith` variants for multi-spinner state tracking
- Updated examples (`single.rs`, `multi.rs`, `demo.rs`) to showcase warn/info finalization

### Changed

- Internal: consolidated test suite — unified `TestWriter` helper, merged overlapping property/unit tests, removed duplicate integration tests (`tests/integration.rs` deleted)

## [0.2.5]

### Changed

- `SpinnerHandle::stop()` and `MultiSpinnerHandle::stop()` now consume `self` instead of borrowing `&self`, consistent with `success()` and `fail()` — the compiler now prevents using a handle after stopping it
- Internal: extracted shared shutdown logic into private `shutdown(&self)` method, used by both `stop()` and `Drop`
- Restructured README: consolidated API docs, removed duplicated TTY/writer sections

## [0.2.4]

### Changed

- Trimmed README: removed and motivation section fluff

## [0.2.3]

### Changed

- `SpinnerHandle::stop()` now takes `&self` instead of `&mut self`, matching the same change made to `MultiSpinnerHandle::stop()` in v0.2.2

## [0.2.2]

### Changed

- `MultiSpinnerHandle::stop()` now takes `&self` instead of `&mut self` for consistent interior mutability API — callers no longer need `mut` bindings just to call `stop()`

## [0.2.1]

### Changed

- Updated README: revised motivation section and expanded comparison table with async support and thread-safety rows

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- `MultiSpinner` for managing multiple concurrent spinners on separate terminal lines
- `MultiSpinnerHandle` with `add()` and `stop()` methods
- `SpinnerLineHandle` for controlling individual spinner lines (`update`, `success`, `success_with`, `fail`, `fail_with`)
- `SpinnerLineHandle::clear()` to silently dismiss a spinner line — remaining lines collapse with no gap
- `MultiSpinner::with_writer()` and `MultiSpinner::with_writer_tty()` for custom output targets
- `SpinnerLineHandle` is `Send` — can be moved to worker threads
- Plain-mode (non-TTY) support for multi-spinner — skips animation, prints plain text on finalization
- New examples: `examples/multi.rs`, `examples/stress.rs`

### Fixed

- Ghost text when spinner message is updated to a shorter string (added `CLEAR_LINE` to `format_frame`)
- Ghost lines left on terminal when `clear()` reduces visible line count in TTY mode

### Changed

- Internal: added property-based tests with `proptest` across all modules

## [0.1.2]

### Changed

- Internal module split: refactored monolithic `lib.rs` into `shared.rs`, `spinner.rs`, `multi.rs` submodules
- No public API changes

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- Automatic TTY detection — ANSI codes and animation skipped when output is piped
- `Spinner::with_writer_tty()` for explicit TTY control

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release of nanospinner
- Single spinner with `Spinner::new()` and `Spinner::with_writer()`
- Background thread animation with braille dot frames (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`)
- `success()`, `fail()`, `success_with()`, `fail_with()` finalization methods
- `update()` for changing the message mid-spin
- `stop()` for clearing without a symbol
- `Drop` implementation for clean shutdown
- Zero dependencies (only `std`)
